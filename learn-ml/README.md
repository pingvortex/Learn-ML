# Learning Neural Networks and Language Models
Welcome to this beginner-friendly documentation set! This guide will teach you the fundamentals of neural networks, language models, and how to train your own machine learning models using a provided code example. The content is structured into multiple Markdown files, each focusing on a specific topic, building your knowledge progressively.
## Table of Contents

1. [**Understanding Machine Learning and Neural Networks**](machine_learning_overview.md) - A broad overview of machine learning and where neural networks fit in.
2. [**How Neural Networks Work**](neural_networks.md) - The basics of neural networks, their structure, and how they learn.
3. [**Language Models (LMs)**](language_models.md) - What language models are and their role in natural language processing.
4. [**Large Language Models (LLMs)**](large_language_models.md) - Advanced language models, their capabilities, and challenges.
5. [**Libraries Used in the Code**](train-your-own-lm/libraries.md) - Detailed explanation of the Python libraries powering the example code.
6. [**Explanation of the Code**](train-your-own-lm/code_explanation.md) - A line-by-line breakdown of the code for fine-tuning a language model.
7. [**Training Your Own Model**](train-your-own-lm/training_your_own_model.md) - A practical, step-by-step guide to train your own model.

## How to Use This Guide

- **Beginners**: Start with Understanding Machine Learning and Neural Networks and follow the order listed above.
- **Hands-On Learners**: After covering the basics, jump to Explanation of the Code and then try Training Your Own Model.
- **Curious Minds**: Explore any topic that interests you—each file is self-contained but includes links to related topics for deeper understanding.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops).
- A computer with Python 3.7+ installed and an internet connection to install packages.
- Curiosity and patience—machine learning is a journey!

## Getting Started
To begin, open Understanding Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Juno learn about the foundations of machine learning and neural networks. From there, explore the other sections to build your skills in training language models.
