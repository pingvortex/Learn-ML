# Training Your Own Model

This section provides a practical, step-by-step guide to train your own language model, building on the code from [Explanation of the Code](code_explanation.md) and concepts from [Large Language Models (LLMs)](./large_language_models.md). It’s designed for hands-on learners ready to apply their knowledge.

## Why Train Your Own Model?

Training your own model allows you to:
- Customize a pre-trained model for specific tasks (e.g., generating domain-specific text).
- Gain hands-on experience with neural networks, as introduced in [How Neural Networks Work](./neural_networks.md).
- Understand the practical challenges of machine learning.

## Prerequisites

- **Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with variables, functions, and loops.
- **Hardware**: A computer with a GPU (optional but recommended for faster training).
- **Software**: Python 3.7+ and an internet connection to install packages.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install Python 3.7 or later from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended to isolate dependencies):
   ```bash
   python -m venv ml-env
   source ml-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ml-env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets matplotlib torch
   ```
   These libraries are explained in [Libraries Used in the Code](libraries.md).

### Step 2: Choose a Model and Dataset

- **Model**:
  - Start with a smaller model like `distilgpt2` (faster training, lower memory requirements).
  - The code uses `PingVortex/VLM-1`, but you can experiment with others from Hugging Face’s model hub.
- **Dataset**:
  - Use a small dataset like `tiny_shakespeare` for quick experiments.
  - The code uses `stas/openwebtext-10k`, suitable for general text tasks.
  - Explore datasets on [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

### Step 3: Modify the Code

Copy the code from [code.py](code.py) into a Python script (e.g., `train.py`) or Jupyter notebook. Update the configuration section:

```python
MODEL_NAME = "distilgpt2"  # Change to your chosen model
DATASET_NAME = "stas/openwebtext-10k"  # Change to your chosen dataset
OUTPUT_DIR = "./gpt2_finetuned"
FINAL_MODEL_DIR = "./final_model"
NUM_EPOCHS = 3
BATCH_SIZE = 4  # Reduce if you have limited GPU memory
LEARNING_RATE = 2e-5
EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE = 2
BLOCK_SIZE = 512
```

- **BATCH_SIZE**: Start with 4 or 8, adjusting based on your GPU memory.
- **NUM_EPOCHS**: 3-5 is sufficient for initial experiments.
- **LEARNING_RATE**: Keep at `2e-5` for stability, but experiment later.

### Step 4: Run the Training

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save your modified code as `train.py`.
2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   - If using a Jupyter notebook, run each cell sequentially.
3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Watch the console for training progress (loss values logged every 50 steps).
   - Check `OUTPUT_DIR` for checkpoints saved each epoch.

### Step 5: Evaluate Results

1. **Check the Training Plot**:
   - Open `training_plot.png` in `FINAL_MODEL_DIR` to visualize training and validation loss.
   - **Ideal Case**: Both losses decrease steadily.
   - **Overfitting**: Validation loss increases while training loss decreases.
2. **Test the Model**:
   - Load the saved model for inference (e.g., generate text):
     ```python
     from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./final_model")
     model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./final_model")
     inputs = tokenizer("Once upon a time", return_tensors="pt")
     outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
     print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
     ```
3. **Iterate**:
   - If results are poor, adjust `NUM_EPOCHS`, `LEARNING_RATE`, or `BATCH_SIZE`.
   - If overfitting occurs, increase `EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE` or reduce `NUM_EPOCHS`.

### Step 6: Experiment and Scale

- **Try Different Datasets**: Use domain-specific data (e.g., medical texts, code snippets).
- **Explore Models**: Test larger models like `gpt2-medium` if you have more resources.
- **Tune Hyperparameters**: Experiment with `LEARNING_RATE` (e.g., `1e-5` or `5e-5`) or `BLOCK_SIZE`.

## Tips for Success

- **Start Small**: Use small models and datasets to learn the process.
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch GPU memory usage to avoid crashes (use tools like `nvidia-smi`).
- **Save Checkpoints**: Ensure `OUTPUT_DIR` and `FINAL_MODEL_DIR` are set to avoid losing progress.
- **Read Documentation**: Refer to [Libraries Used in the Code](libraries.md) for library-specific guides.
- **Join Communities**: Engage with forums like Hugging Face or Reddit for troubleshooting.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Out of Memory Error**:
  - Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` or `BLOCK_SIZE`.
  - Enable `fp16=True` (already set in the code).
- **Poor Performance**:
  - Increase `NUM_EPOCHS` or try a different dataset.
  - Check for data quality issues (e.g., noisy or irrelevant text).
- **Training Stalls**:
  - Verify internet connection for dataset/model downloads.
  - Restart the script, as checkpoints are saved.
