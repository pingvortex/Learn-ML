# Libraries Used in the Code

This section explains the Python libraries used in the code from [Explanation of the Code](code_explanation.md). These libraries simplify the process of building and training neural networks, particularly for language models discussed in [Language Models (LMs)](./language_models.md) and [Large Language Models (LLMs)](./large_language_models.md).

## Overview

The code leverages four key libraries:
- **Transformers**: For pre-trained models and NLP tools.
- **Datasets**: For efficient data loading and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress.
- **Torch (PyTorch)**: For building and training neural networks.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each.

## 1. Transformers

- **Purpose**: Provides access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing, developed by Hugging Face.
- **Key Features**:
  - Pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and the model used in the code (`PingVortex/VLM-1`).
  - Easy-to-use interfaces for tokenization, model loading, and training.
  - Support for fine-tuning, as shown in [Explanation of the Code](code_explanation.md).
- **In the Code**:
  - Loads the tokenizer and model.
  - Configures the trainer for fine-tuning.
- **Why Use It?**: Simplifies working with complex models, saving time and effort.

## 2. Datasets

- **Purpose**: A Hugging Face library for loading, processing, and managing datasets efficiently.
- **Key Features**:
  - Fast data loading and caching.
  - Integration with datasets like `stas/openwebtext-10k`, used in the code.
  - Support for preprocessing tasks like tokenization.
- **In the Code**:
  - Loads the dataset and splits it into training and validation sets.
  - Applies tokenization to prepare data for the model.
- **Why Use It?**: Streamlines data handling, crucial for training neural networks.

## 3. Matplotlib

- **Purpose**: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simple syntax for line plots, scatter plots, and more.
  - Customizable for professional-quality graphics.
- **In the Code**:
  - Plots training and validation loss curves to monitor model performance.
  - Saves the plot to a file for analysis.
- **Why Use It?**: Helps visualize training progress, identifying issues like overfitting.

## 4. Torch (PyTorch)

- **Purpose**: An open-source machine learning framework for building and training neural networks, as introduced in [How Neural Networks Work](./neural_networks.md).
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic computation graphs for flexible model design.
  - GPU acceleration for faster training.
  - Extensive tools for optimization and loss functions.
- **In the Code**:
  - Underpins the model training process (used internally by Transformers).
  - Supports mixed precision training (`fp16`) to reduce memory usage.
- **Why Use It?**: Offers power and flexibility for deep learning tasks.

## Why These Libraries?

These libraries are industry standards, offering:
- **Abstraction**: Simplify complex tasks like tokenization and training.
- **Community Support**: Large communities provide tutorials and troubleshooting.
- **Integration**: Work seamlessly together, as seen in the code.
