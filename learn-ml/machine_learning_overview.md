# Understanding Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This section provides a broad overview of machine learning (ML) and explains where neural networks fit within the field. It’s designed to give you a foundational understanding before diving into more technical topics like [How Neural Networks Work](neural_networks.md).

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Instead of following rigid rules, ML models identify patterns in data to perform tasks such as:

- Classifying emails as spam or not.
- Recognizing objects in images.
- Predicting stock prices.

### Key Concepts

- **Data**: The foundation of ML. Data can be text, images, numbers, or other formats.
- **Model**: A mathematical structure that learns patterns from data.
- **Training**: The process of feeding data to the model to improve its performance.
- **Prediction/Inference**: Using the trained model to make decisions on new, unseen data.

### Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data, where each input has a corresponding output (e.g., classifying images as cats or dogs).
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., grouping customers by purchasing behavior).
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties (e.g., training an AI to play chess).

Neural networks, which we’ll explore in [How Neural Networks Work](neural_networks.md), are commonly used in supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Where Do Neural Networks Fit In?

Neural networks are a powerful type of ML model inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process data and learn complex patterns. Neural networks excel in tasks like:

- Image recognition.
- Natural language processing (NLP), as seen in [Language Models (LMs)](language_models.md).
- Speech synthesis.

### Why Use Neural Networks?

- **Flexibility**: They can model complex, non-linear relationships in data.
- **Scalability**: Performance improves with more data and computational power.
- **Versatility**: Applicable across domains like healthcare, finance, and entertainment.

However, neural networks require significant data and computational resources, making them ideal for advanced applications.
