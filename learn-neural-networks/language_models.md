# Language Models (LMs)

This section introduces language models, their purpose, and how they leverage neural networks, building on concepts from [How Neural Networks Work](neural_networks.md). It sets the stage for [Large Language Models (LLMs)](large_language_models.md).

## What is a Language Model?

A language model (LM) is a machine learning model designed to understand and generate human language. It predicts the probability of a sequence of words, enabling tasks like:

- Autocompleting text in search bars.
- Translating languages.
- Generating coherent paragraphs.

LMs are critical in natural language processing (NLP), a field focused on enabling computers to process and understand text or speech.

## How Do Language Models Work?

LMs are trained on large text datasets to learn language patterns, such as grammar, context, and semantics. They can be:

- **Statistical**: Use word frequency and co-occurrence (e.g., n-gram models, which predict the next word based on the previous n words).
- **Neural**: Use neural networks to capture complex patterns, as described in [How Neural Networks Work](neural_networks.md).

Modern LMs primarily use neural architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, with Transformers being the state-of-the-art due to their efficiency and ability to handle long-range dependencies.

### Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large corpus of text (e.g., books, articles, web pages).
2. **Tokenization**: Break text into smaller units (words or subwords), as seen in [Explanation of the Code](code_explanation.md).
3. **Training**: Feed tokenized text into the model, optimizing it to predict the next word or sequence.
4. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt the model for specific tasks, like summarization or dialogue.

## Applications of Language Models

- **Text Generation**: Creating stories, articles, or code.
- **Machine Translation**: Converting text between languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotions in text (e.g., positive or negative reviews).
- **Chatbots**: Powering conversational AI like virtual assistants.

The code in [Explanation of the Code](code_explanation.md) fine-tunes a language model for text generation.

## Challenges

- **Data Quality**: Models can learn biases present in training data.
- **Computational Cost**: Training requires significant resources.
- **Context Limitations**: Early LMs struggled with long contexts, though Transformers mitigate this.

## Next Steps

Learn about advanced language models in [Large Language Models (LLMs)](large_language_models.md), or explore the tools used to build them in [Libraries Used in the Code](libraries.md).
